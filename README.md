Tetris-or-QuadraPassal
======================

A java implementation of Tetris using the acm graphics library. This version uses the original
tetris algorithm rather than the algorithm with chain reaction.


If you do not have the acm library you can download it from here:


http://jtf.acm.org/#Downloads
 
download the acm.jar archive file and save it in the same directory as the rest of these files.

I actually downloaded an audio file in the .au format for music.
You may do the same. just save it with whatever name you want, but remember to change 'mario.au' to your 
chosen filename. Save all of these items in the same folder.
Launch the game by compling and starting Playgame.


This game won't play if you do not have the library.

There are still some bugs lurking around. But after playing around 70 consecutive games and getting correct behaviour
around 65 times (not to mention an ache in my fingers), I have decided to leave them there. I might actually sit down 
one winter evening and debug them. But since I haven't done exhaustive testing, please bear with me. 



Hope you have fun with this game.
